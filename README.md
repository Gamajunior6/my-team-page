<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview


It wasn't a tough project, but making a decision on what type of tag to use was tough. Initially i started  up the project using div to divide both image and it works but the problem was i felt it wasn't the right syntax, and the name was not aligning on to the image so i change it. Here is a demo of the code:

 - [ 
    <!--<div class="Photos">
    <div class="Album_1">
        <img src="/images/photo1.png" alt="photo1">
        <span> PRODUCT OWNER</span>
        <p class="p">Bill Mahoney</p>
        <img src="/images/photo2.png" class="photo" alt="photo2">
        <span>ART DIRECTOR</span>
        <p class="p">Saba Cabrera</p>
        <img src="/images/photo3.png" alt="photo3">
       <span> TECH LEAD </span>
       <p class="p">Shae Le</p>
      </div>
        <div class="Album_2">
        <img src="/images/photo4.png" alt="photo4">
        <span> UX DESIGNER</span>
        <p class="p">Skylah</p>
        <img src="/images/photo5.png" class="photo" alt="photo5">
         <span>DEVELOPER</span>
        <p class="p">Griff Richards</p>
        <img src="/images/photo6.png" alt="photo6S">
         <span>DEVELOPER</span>
        <p class="p">Star John</p>
      </div>
    </div>-->]


- [Where can I see your demo?]
On github, a link below is shared.

- [What was your experience?]
My experience was changing the image container div to ul-li tag, which was more simpler.
- [What have you learned/improved?]
I learn how to use many image with the ul-li tag to arrange the images. 
- [Your wisdom?:]
To keep learning and improving and also using different syntax when the need arrise.
